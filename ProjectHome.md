An implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic specifications. FPFD is designed to implement both decimal encodings specified in 754-2008, DPD (Densely-Packed-Decimal) and so-called BID (Binary-Integer-Decimal). The implementation is designed to be fast, with a mixed assembly-language and C implementation of a C interface resembling that of MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org). One main goal of FPFD is to determine which encoding is faster, on a variety of platforms.
