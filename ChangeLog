Version 0.0.1 (October 5, 2008, Revision 133)

        This release is also not functional or complete; it has been released
        because the fpfd32_impl_scale routines are complete for all encodings
        and architectures. As a result, fpfd32_mul should work completely for
        the binary encoding, though this has not been well tested. The other
        major change affects the API of nearly every function; fpfd now supports
        an enumerated type, fpfd_flags_t, which represents the IEEE 754-2008
        exception flags. A pointer to an fpfd_flags_t may be passed to almost
        every fpfd function as the last parameter, or NULL if an application
        does not wish to deal with these flags. Below is a summary of
        implementation status of various components.

Version 0.0.0 (October 5, 2008, Revision 110)

        This release is not nearly functional or complete; it is being released
        because the fpfd32_impl_scale algorithms are nearly complete for each
        architecture, and a stable implementation which is guaranteed to
        compile may be of some value. The implementation status of various
        components follows:

        =======
        x86 DPD

        Implemented:
         - fpfd32_impl_expand

         - fpfd32_impl_scale
         - fpfd32_impl_inc

        Partially implemented:
         - fpfd32_impl_addsub: Non-functional stub.

        Missing:
         - fpfd32_impl_mul
         - fpfd32_impl_div

        =======
        x86 BID

         - fpfd32_impl_mul

        Partially implemented:
         - fpfd32_impl_scale: Only handles 32-bit values, doesn't subnormalize
                              correctly.
