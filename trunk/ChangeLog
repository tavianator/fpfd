Version 0.0.0 (October 5, 2008, Revision 110)

	This release is not nearly functional or complete; it is being released
	because the fpfd32_impl_scale algorithms are nearly complete for each
	architecture, and a stable implementation which is guaranteed to
	compile may be of some value. The implementation status of various
	components follows:

	=======
	x86 DPD
	=======

	Implemented:
	 - fpfd32_impl_expand
	 - fpfd32_impl_compress
	 - fpfd32_impl_scale
	 - fpfd32_impl_inc

	Partially implemented:
	 - fpfd32_impl_addsub: Non-functional stub.

	Missing:
	 - fpfd32_impl_mul
	 - fpfd32_impl_div

	=======
	x86 BID
	=======

	Implemented:
	 - fpfd32_impl_expand
	 - fpfd32_impl_compress
	 - fpfd32_impl_inc
	 - fpfd32_impl_mul

	Partially implemented:
	 - fpfd32_impl_scale: Only handles 32-bit values, doesn't subnormalize
	                      correctly.

	Missing:
	 - fpfd32_impl_addsub
	 - fpfd32_impl_div

	==========

	==========

	Implemented:

	 - fpfd32_impl_scale
	 - fpfd32_impl_inc

	Missing:
	 - fpfd32_impl_addsub
	 - fpfd32_impl_mul
	 - fpfd32_impl_div
